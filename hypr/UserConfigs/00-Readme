Hyprland-Dots v2.2.2

1.) Suggest not to rename files in this folder. As this is connected and being sourced from hyprland.conf in ~/.config/hypr

2.) This folder, along with UserScripts folder will NOT be touch during update.

3.) However, if hyprland has a big change in settings, i.e., blur section is moved into another group, you should managed the change.

I will update the Hyprland-Dots wiki for guidance. Make sure to check out changelogs as well
